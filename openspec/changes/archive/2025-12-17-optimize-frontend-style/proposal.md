# Optimize Frontend Style

## Goal
Optimize the frontend style of `App.vue` to be modern and concise without adding new libraries or affecting functionality.

## Summary
The current `App.vue` styles are functional but could benefit from a visual refresh to align with modern design trends. This proposal aims to:
- Use CSS variables more consistently from `main.css`.
- Refine the navigation bar aesthetics (gradients, transparency, spacing).
- Ensure a cleaner, more concise layout.
- Maintain the existing dark theme identity.

## Motivation
To improve the user experience and visual appeal of the application, making it feel more professional and polished.

## Stakeholders
- Users: Better visual experience.
- Developers: Cleaner CSS code.
