# Change: Refine Home Page Style for a Modern and Concise Look

## Why

The current home page, while functional, can be visually refined to look more modern and professional. Users benefit from a more concise layout that reduces cognitive load and highlights the most important actions and information.

## What Changes

- **Layout Optimization**: Group related sections more tightly (e.g., Workflow and Quick Actions) to reduce vertical scrolling.
- **Visual Polish**: 
  - Enhance background with subtle radial gradients and glassmorphism.
  - Refine typography, spacing, and border treatments.
  - Improve hover effects and transitions.
- **Conciseness**: 
  - Compact the dashboard header.
  - Simplify the tech stack footer.
  - Use more elegant icons and status indicators.

## Impact

- **Affected code**: 
  - `frontend/src/views/HomeView.vue`
  - `frontend/src/components/dashboard/*.vue`
